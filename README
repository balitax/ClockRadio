Clock Radio

This is the Android Clock Radio project. It is a simple application to 'scratch an itch' - I wanted 
to be able to listen the radio in a hotel and have it turn off via a sleep timer. This is what this does...

It only works on Android 3 tablets (as I wanted to play with the fragments API) and I have only tested it on an Asus.

If you want more stations added add an issue here and I can add them if they have a suitable stream.
